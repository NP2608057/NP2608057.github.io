About Me

HI!I am NP. I adore the thought of editing/making flyers for people and thinking about where music first originated from. Art and being my own boss seems to amaze me. My interest and practice in art seemed to had payed off because every now and then because of how good i am at making art people ask me to draw and make them things! Being my own boss allows me to do so many things at the paste i desire...some days i like engaging with people , while others...i prefer not to because of my social anxiety and shy-ness.However I feel becoming a real estate agent will help me to come out of my shell! I want to be able to communicate with people in a friendly way , in which also allows me to negotiate prices of houses all around the world and my own schedule! Research shows if i were to sell one house per year its a possibility i could make up to $30,000 as a real esate agent!! This career supports the lifestyle I want goal-wise and money-wise! I find creating children stories interesting
